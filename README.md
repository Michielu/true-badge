> “A person’s name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language.” – Dale Carnegie.

Names are a wonderful thing. A person’s name is the greatest connection to their own identity. Being able to pronounce someone’s name correctly, -- as the person themselves wants it pronounced – is a sign of courtesy, respect, and care.

We help you bridge the gap between face to names. We bundle your name, face, and how YOU pronounce your name onto one portable web page -- which you are given as a link -- so that you can share it with everyone.
